# PyViz Assignment
## Overview
In this assignment, I have used data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis to identify properties in the San Francisco housing market that could be viable investment opportunities. 

In Step 3, users are able to interact with the visualisation by selecting different neighborhoods in San Francisco in the dropdown menu, displaying the sale price and gross rent figures in the line plot.

Further down the page users are able to interact with a geospatial visualisation, where you can hover over the dot icons to view data about the housing market, and by using the options on the right of the chart, users can zoom and move around the map.
